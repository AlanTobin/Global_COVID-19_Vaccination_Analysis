COVID-19 has taken a tremendous toll on people all around the world. COVID-19 vaccines have recently been introduced and provided to the public. Arguably, these vaccines are our best at hope at fighting back against the virus and returning back to a sense of normalcy. This project has taken me approximately 40-45 hours to complete as I have had to learn about data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) in Python and learn how to implement them in order to complete an actual data science project with Python. Additionally, I used Kaggle, a site that contains data science and machine learning resources, to gather the data that I worked with in this project (COVID-19 vaccination data). As you can see in the .ipynb file that contains the content of my project, the code that I wrote is highly commented and elaborated. I mainly put this there to assist myself in the process of finishing the project (as it helped me understand everything that I was doing) and to aid others if they ever use this as a baseline for another data science project. Hopefully, with the introduction and implementation of these vaccines, we can prevent the virus from affecting additional people and stop it from impacting our lives.
